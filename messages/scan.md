# summary

Scan the Data Code Extension %s package for permissions and dependencies.

# description

Scans Python files in an initialized Data Code Extension package directory to identify required permissions and dependencies. Updates the config.json and requirements.txt files based on the code analysis.

# examples.script

- Scan with a custom entrypoint file:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension script scan --entrypoint ./my-script-package/payload/entrypoint.py

- Perform a dry run to see what would be changed:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension script scan --entrypoint ./my-script-package/payload/entrypoint.py --dry-run

- Scan without updating the requirements.txt file:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension script scan --entrypoint ./my-script-package/payload/entrypoint.py --no-requirements

# examples.function

- Scan with a custom entrypoint file:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension function scan --entrypoint ./my-function-package/payload/entrypoint.py

- Perform a dry run to see what would be changed:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension function scan --entrypoint ./my-function-package/payload/entrypoint.py --dry-run

- Scan without updating the requirements.txt file:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension function scan --entrypoint ./my-function-package/payload/entrypoint.py --no-requirements
