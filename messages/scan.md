# summary

Scan the Data Code Extension %s package for permissions and dependencies.

# description

Scans Python files in an initialized Data Code Extension package directory to identify required permissions and dependencies. Updates the config.json and requirements.txt files based on the code analysis.

# examples.script

- Scan with a custom entrypoint file:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension script scan --entrypoint ./my-script-package/payload/entrypoint.py

- Perform a dry run to see what would be changed:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension script scan --entrypoint ./my-script-package/payload/entrypoint.py --dry-run

- Scan without updating the requirements.txt file:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension script scan --entrypoint ./my-script-package/payload/entrypoint.py --no-requirements

# examples.function

- Scan with a custom entrypoint file:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension function scan --entrypoint ./my-function-package/payload/entrypoint.py

- Perform a dry run to see what would be changed:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension function scan --entrypoint ./my-function-package/payload/entrypoint.py --dry-run

- Scan without updating the requirements.txt file:

  <%= config.bin %> data-code-extension function scan --entrypoint ./my-function-package/payload/entrypoint.py --no-requirements

# error.scanFailed

Failed to scan Data Code Extension package

# error.configNotFound

Config file not found at '%s'

# error.notInPackageDir

Current directory is not an initialized Data Code Extension package. Run 'init' first.

# error.scanPermissionDenied

Permission denied when scanning package at '%s'

# error.scanExecutionFailed

Failed to scan package at '%s': %s

# actions.configNotFound

- Verify the config file path is correct
- Check if you're in the right directory
- Run 'init' command first if package is not initialized
- Use default entrypoint path: payload/entrypoint.py

# actions.notInPackageDir

- Change to an initialized package directory
- Run 'data-code-extension %s init' first to initialize a package
- Check that config.json exists in the payload directory

# actions.scanPermissionDenied

- Check that you have read permissions for the directory
- Verify all Python files are readable
- Ensure the config file is writable

# actions.scanExecutionFailed

- Verify the datacustomcode binary is properly installed
- Check that the package directory contains valid Python files
- Run 'datacustomcode version' to verify the binary works
- Check the error message for specific issues

# flags.configFile.summary

Path to an alternate config file.

# flags.configFile.description

Optional path to an alternate JSON config file to use instead of the package's default config. The file must exist. Useful for testing different configurations without modifying the package's primary config.json.

# flags.entrypoint.summary

Path to the entrypoint Python file to scan.

# flags.entrypoint.description

The path to the entrypoint Python file that will be analyzed. Defaults to 'payload/entrypoint.py' in the current directory.

# flags.dryRun.summary

Preview changes without modifying any files.

# flags.dryRun.description

When set, performs a scan and shows what would be changed but does not modify any files. Useful for reviewing changes before applying them.

# flags.noRequirements.summary

Skip updating the requirements.txt file.

# flags.noRequirements.description

When set, only scans for permissions and updates config.json, but doesn't update the requirements.txt file with discovered dependencies.
